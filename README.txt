I made this technical test really easy to run and test;

Firstly navigate to this main folder via command prompt and run the application by entering "flask run", this will run the project which will
show a localhost end point which you can copy and paste to your browser.

With the end point copied into the URL section of the browser you should see a table and a form pop up which is where the main application lies,
the table will already be filled with all stores alphabetically stored.

You can then test the search functionality by entering a Postcode and Radius which would update then table of contents.

To run the Unit test's open Unit_Test.py and run the file via python compiler, this will promptly start the individual unit test's and return if the test's have passed or not.

Tell us what test you completed (backend or full-stack)

Backend


Tell us what you'd have changed if you'd have had more time?

I would split the files up to make it more clear for other developers, I would also find another way to sort my dictionary as the current way is confusing.


What bits did you find the toughest? What bit are you most proud of? In both cases, why?

I think the part I found the toughest was making sure I had the all the stores within the given radius and postcode, I am also proud of this part of the test for the same reason it being difficult.


What's one thing we could do to improve this test?

I think the test overall was very well and planned out though if I were to change it personally I would elaborate on ordering the searched stores from north to south.
