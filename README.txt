I made this technical test really easy to run;

Firstly navigate to this main folder and run the application by entering "flask run", this will run the project which will
show a localhost end point which you can copy and paste to your browser.

With the end point copied into the URL section of the browser you should see a table and a form pop up which is where the main application lies,
the table will already be filled with default stores alphabetically stored.

You can then test the system by entering in a postcode and a radius which would promptly load the stores within the postcode and radius.

Have fun.
