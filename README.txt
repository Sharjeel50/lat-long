Tell us what test you completed (backend or full-stack)

Backend


Tell us what you'd have changed if you'd have had more time?

I would split the files up to make it more clear for other developers and so it is less cluttered, I would also find another way to sort my dictionary as the current way is confusing.
I would also try to lower the time complexity of this application to get it as fast as possible.


What bits did you find the toughest? What bit are you most proud of? In both cases, why?

I think the part I found the toughest was making sure I had the all the stores within the given radius and postcode, I found this part of the test tough as I had to use an alternate method
to get postcodes within a larger radius size. I am similarly proud of the same section of the test as I was able to come up with a simple solution.



What's one thing we could do to improve this test?

I think the test overall was very well and planned out though if I were to change it personally I would elaborate on ordering the searched stores from north to south.
