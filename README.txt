I made this technical test really easy to run and test;

Firstly navigate to this main folder via command prompt and run the application by entering "flask run", this will run the project which will
show a localhost end point which you can copy and paste to your browser.

With the end point copied into the URL section of the browser you should see a table and a form pop up which is where the main application lies,
the table will already be filled with all stores alphabetically stored.

You can then test the search functionality by entering a Postcode and Radius which would update then table of contents.

To run the Unit test's open Unit_Test.py and run the file via python compiler, this will promptly start the written test cases.

Tell us what test you completed (backend or full-stack)

Backend


Tell us what you'd have changed if you'd have had more time?

I would split the files up to make it more clear for other developers and so it is less cluttered, I would also find another way to sort my dictionary as the current way is confusing.
I would also try to lower the time complexity of this application to get it as fast as possible.
I would additionally find a way to make sure I don't call the API so much which further makes the application slower.


What bits did you find the toughest? What bit are you most proud of? In both cases, why?

I think the part I found the toughest was making sure I had the all the stores within the given radius and postcode, I am also proud of this part of the test for the same reason it being difficult.


What's one thing we could do to improve this test?

I think the test overall was very well and planned out though if I were to change it personally I would elaborate on ordering the searched stores from north to south.
